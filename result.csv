Do you dig the Twitters and TikToks? Thanks to social media, we can instantly find out which handbag Khloé Kardashian is using today! Fun! A million years from now, archeologists will uncover an iPad buried deep underground, turn it on (‘cause there’s still enough juice in the battery!), and experience the joys of YouTube megastar Jake Paul like their ancestors once did! But while learning about the past (and by “past” I mean the “present” today but will someday be the past in the future) will become increasingly easy in the future, learning about the past can be difficult<em> today</em> because, like, Alexander the Great didn’t govern by Tweet. For this reason, there are archeological findings and the histories of certain ancient civilizations that we will never fully understand. Here are 8 questions we’ll probably never solve.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What does the Voynich Manuscript mean?</h2><p>This mysterious manuscript, named after Polish book dealer Wilfrid Voynich who purchased it in 1912, has been confounding cryptographers who have spent the subsequent 100+ years trying to make sense of the writings and illustrations contained within. For example, none of the sketched out plants have been identified as anything that exists in reality, and the text consists of more than 170,000 different characters. It was originally suspected that Voynich himself created it to attract publicity and cause some mischief, but carbon dating indicates 15th century origins, so probably not.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""960"" height=""732"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84529"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-1.jpg 960w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-1-393x300.jpg 393w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-1-768x586.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px""></figure><h2>2. What’s the deal with the Bent Pyramid?</h2><p>Everybody knows what pyramids are shaped like, right? Like pyramids, duh! Ah, but like many things there are exceptions to the rule, my friends. For instance, a pyramid built during the reign of the Pharaoh Snefru is decidedly different. While the way the lower base was built is consistent with your typical pyramid, things start to get weird as you go higher. The angle of the slope abruptly changes and they ended up with, well, what they ended up with. One theory is that it had to be finished hastily in response to the unexpected death of the person it was intended for. But we like to believe the giant aliens who made it lost their patience when building what was intended to be an elaborate sand castle, patting the top of it with their hands and saying, “We’re done here.”&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""577"" height=""357"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-2.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84530"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-2.png 577w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-2-400x247.png 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px""></figure><h2>3. What purpose did the Plain of Jars serve?</h2><p>Imagine this: you’re wandering around the mountains of Laos when, low and behold, you come across a bunch of large stone jars scattered about, some of which are 10 feet tall. What!? We dunno. They were created around 2500 years ago, and the abundance of nearby human bones might suggest the jars were used for purposes of cremation or perhaps to house corpses prior to the funeral rites. The locals claim the jars were used to make whisky or rice wine for giants that once lived there, so, um, yep. Probably that. Airtight explanation for sure.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""512"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3-1024x512.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84531"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3-400x200.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-3.jpg 1920w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>4. How did the ancient Greeks know how to make the Antikythera mechanism?</h2><p>This archeological doohickey was found in an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Greece in 1901 and identified a year later as some sort of analogue computer dealie. It contains 30 clock-like bronze gear thingamabobs and is estimated to have been created around 100 BC, although it’s possible this doodad might date a hundred years before that. It seems that this gizmo served as an astrological device since it follows the movement of the moon and sun according to the zodiac. In any event, the technology required to make this whatchamacallit wouldn’t be found again for 1000 years, leading some to conclude that it must be aliens blah blah blah X-Files theme.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""913"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-4-1024x913.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84532"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-4-1024x913.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-4-336x300.jpg 336w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-4-768x685.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-4.jpg 1036w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2>5. What message are the Pictish stones intended to convey?</h2><p>Mysterious, ubiquitous free-standing stones with mysterious carvings dot the whole of Scotland from east to west. They are believed to have been created sometime between 500 and 900 AD. While some of the images are clear – birds and other animals both real or imaginary, and everyday objects like mirrors and combs – others can’t be identified. But in all cases, it’s not certain what the intent is. To tell a story? To showcase mad mirror-drawing skills? I’ve got nothing.</p><p></p><center class=""native_ad""><!-- Composite Start --><div id=""M114019ScriptRootC208013""><!-- <div id=""M114019PreloadC208013""> -->        <!-- Loading...    </div> -->        <iframe style=""display: none;""></iframe><div id=""MarketGidComposite208013"" style=""overflow: visible; visibility: visible;""><div class=""mgbox""><!--advertPrefix--></div></div></div><!-- Composite End --></center><p></p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""500"" height=""333"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-5.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84533"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-5.jpg 500w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-5-400x266.jpg 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px""></figure><h2>6. Why did the original residents of Teotihuacan abandon the city?</h2><p>Once upon a time in the 13th century, the Aztecs came upon a city that had all of the hallmarks of a sophisticated civilization – roads, palaces, pyramids, and even irrigation systems. But whoever had lived there just got up and vanished 600 years earlier, leaving everything as it was. While the Aztecs named the city Teotihuacan, nobody knows what the original inhabitants called it since there are no written records. The Pyramid of the Sun, the world’s third largest pyramid, is still standing to this day. And if you close your eyes, you can imagine ancient people along the mile-long Avenue of the Dead with carts hawking fake Rolexes or whatever.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""512"" height=""341"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-6.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84534"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-6.jpg 512w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-6-400x266.jpg 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px""></figure><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>7. What happened to the Angkor Wat civilization?</h2><p>In 1860, French explorer Henri Mouhot was wandering around a jungle in Cambodia when he stumbled across a spectacular Buddhist monastery that had been concealed behind the trees. When he asked the monks and farmers about the history of the area, they just shrugged. Eventually, historians were able to gain more insight and discovered that Angkor Wat was once home to a powerful empire that existed from 800 AD until the empire collapsed 600 years later. The Angkor Wat monastery is only a small part of what had been a huge city. The rest of it – including houses and rice fields – are buried under the jungle. Nobody knows where the folks went, but they were gone within a very short period of time.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-7.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84535"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-7.jpg 1000w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-7-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-7-768x512.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px""></figure><h2>8. How did Thonis-Heracleion end up at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea?&nbsp;</h2><p>Around 700 BC, the Egyptian port city of Thonis-Heracleion was a pretty happening place. It contained magnificent 16-foot tall statues, animal sarcophagi, bridges and everything else you’d expect from an Egyptian city 2,700 years ago. And then suddenly it wasn’t such a happening place. It literally disappeared from time only to be rediscovered at the bottom of the sea along the Egyptian coast in the early 2000s. What gives? Well, if we knew the answer, it would have been silly to include this on the list, right?&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""512"" height=""319"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-8.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84536"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-8.jpg 512w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Ancient-Mysteries-We-May-Never-Know-the-Answers-To-8-400x249.jpg 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px""></figure><p></p><p></p></div>"

A set of bath towels from Target/Tesco? A used 2012 Honda Civic? A romantic weekend getaway for two in Davenport, Iowa? If you answered “yes” to any of these gift options, it might be time to reconsider your relationship. The truth is, when you’re famous and have millions of dollars to spare, you have to go all-out. You have to think outside the box and give your friend/partner/spouse something that’s only available to a small handful of people. To help generate some ideas, consider these 8 crazy, lavish gifts that celebrities have given their loved ones.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>1. A Bunch of Burger King Franchises</strong></h2><p>Buying your wife a Whopper with extra cheese and hold-the-mayo is a pretty nice gesture. But if you’re Kanye West, you take things to the next level and buy wife Kim Kardashian 10 Burger Kings. And not just a bunch of BK restaurants in Los Angeles either. She owns the right to open franchises in far flung places like Rome, France and London because why not? However, more than 6 years after she received this wedding gift, none of the Burger Kings have actually materialized.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""775"" height=""775"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84373"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84373"" class=""wp-image-84373"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1.jpg 775w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1-200x200.jpg 200w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-1-1-768x768.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84374"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84374"" class=""wp-image-84374"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-2.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/interesting/the-most-expensive-fast-food-in-the-world/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>The Most Expensive Fast Food In The World</strong></a></p><h2><strong>2.

Seems that a gift that special would lead to a marriage full of eternal bliss. However, it wasn’t meant to be for this couple. Married in 2008, they divorced three years later.&nbsp;</p><p></p><center class=""native_ad""><!-- Composite Start --><div id=""M114019ScriptRootC208013""><!-- <div id=""M114019PreloadC208013""> -->        <!-- Loading...    </div> -->        <iframe style=""display: none;""></iframe><div id=""MarketGidComposite208013"" style=""overflow: visible; visibility: visible;""><div class=""mgbox""><!--advertPrefix--></div></div></div><!-- Composite End --></center><p></p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""737"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-737x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84381"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-scaled.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84381"" class=""wp-image-84381"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-737x1024.jpg 737w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-216x300.jpg 216w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-768x1067.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-1106x1536.jpg 1106w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-1474x2048.jpg 1474w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-8-1-scaled.jpg 1843w"" sizes=""(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7-1024x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84379"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84379"" class=""wp-image-84379"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7-300x300.jpg 300w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7-200x200.jpg 200w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7-768x768.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Celebrity-Crazy-Expensive-Present-7.jpg 1370w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><h2><strong>5. Private Dinner at the Staples Center</strong></h2><p>For regular peasants like us, the only real chance to ever get inside the Staples Center — home of the LA Lakers — is to see the Clippers play. Just thinking about that makes me want to nod off. Justin Bieber, on the other hand, gets to drop by the Staples Center whenever he feels like it. Back when he was 17, he rented the entire arena out to host a date with on again, off again girlfriend Selena Gomez.

A skill wanted by many, but only truly mastered by a select few. First impressions are the hardest, since they last the longest. A good first date can set the foundation for your future relationship, which makes it all the more important to appear like you’re a normal, stable and sane human being. Don’t worry, you don’t actually have to be, just fool your date once and you’re golden.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some things that you’re probably better off not saying on a first date. Or you could play expert mode of the dating game and say all of them. It’d be like the Dark Souls of real life, I’m sure there’s people that’d like that.</p><h2><strong>Anything About Your Last Relationship</strong></h2><p>Look, everyone has a story. Everyone’s been through things. And it’s all fine and dandy that you’re trying to be open about it, but a first date is no place to discuss your previous relationship.

Endless cornfields, lawns full of weeds, average-sized oak trees with green leaves. And water! Boo! Nothing makes me want to yawn more than the thought of a colorless, odorless liquid that doesn’t taste like anything. However, compiling a list of nature’s most boring phenomena won’t generate very many clicks. On the other hand, discussing some of the most beautiful natural wonders might just make me a hero around the office. So that’s what I’ve decided to treat you to! Here are 12 colorful places around the world.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>1. Rio Tinto, Spain</strong></h2><p>Rising in the Sierra Morena Mountains of southwestern Spain, this 60-mile (100 kilometers) river gets its stunning orange and red colors from copper, iron, and other heavy metals. The best way to enjoy the beauty is by visiting the small mining town of Nerva. Note that only about half the length of the river features these colors. Once you reach the town of Nieba it looks like just another boring, non-toxic river.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""684"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1024x684.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84282"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-768x513.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01.jpg 2024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2. Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada</strong></h2><p>Known by First Nation folks as Ho-run-num-nay (Lake of the Little Fishes), this glacial lake located in Banff National Park gets its turquoise color from finely grained rock particles contained within the ice as it melts in the lake. If you’re a big fan of the movie <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>, you’ll be happy to know that there also happens to be a Lake Thelma.

To see them with your own eyes, mosey on up to the Luberon and Verdon plateau regions north of Aix-en-Provence and Marseille, or head east past Avignon.

Who dumped all that Pepto Bismol into the lake?” you ask because you’re clever and figure nobody has ever made that joke before. It actually gets its color from — you guessed it — algae!

The “land of the free” is free again now that Donald Trump is no longer protected by the presidential immunity. On January 19, the whole world was watching with excitement as the 45th president of the United States stepped down from his post and moved out of the White House to make room for the new POTUS. After placing his hand on the Bible, the 78-year-old Joe Biden took an oath of allegiance to the American people and became the oldest president in US history. Due to the COVID situation, Biden’s inauguration was a bit stiff, but we got a great show despite all the security and other precautions.</p><p>For some reason, even days after the big event, people are still talking about fashion choices, but not Biden’s or JLo’s style. This time it was Bernie freaking Sanders’s old winter jacket and knitted mittens, turning the Vermont senator into a fresh new meme on the Internet (#BernieMittens). But of course, aside from Bernie, there were other memorable moments during the inauguration. Let’s take a look at the 25 most hilarious inauguration day memes!</p><div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-6538405534053290"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:750px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 750px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:750px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""750"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?guci=2.2.0.0.2.2.0.0&amp;client=ca-pub-6538405534053290&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=532710751&amp;adf=2763117718&amp;pi=t.aa~a.1381849204~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=750&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1611692486&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=5134042781&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=750x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrainberries.co%2Ffunny%2F25-hilarious-2021-inauguration-day-memes%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=188&amp;rw=750&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;adsid=NT&amp;dt=1611692486957&amp;bpp=3&amp;bdt=788&amp;idt=3&amp;shv=r20210121&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D832f60962303255c-22331c6cacb90009%3AT%3D1611692427%3ART%3D1611692427%3AS%3DALNI_MYiS1kNSauDs7qpx5yUW9LNeHNVGw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C750x300&amp;nras=2&amp;correlator=7277831518422&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1655176694.1611692424&amp;ga_sid=1611692486&amp;ga_hid=1180041995&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=180&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=600&amp;u_w=800&amp;u_ah=600&amp;u_aw=800&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=0&amp;u_nmime=0&amp;adx=25&amp;ady=1037&amp;biw=800&amp;bih=600&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066700%2C21066793%2C42530671%2C21066428%2C21066431%2C21068769&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3894533707601126&amp;pem=75&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C800%2C0%2C800%2C600%2C800%2C600&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=Xcwwalde2S&amp;p=https%3A//brainberries.co&amp;dtd=42"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CIHmurG2uu4CFRNO4Aod5gIE1w"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div><p>1.The bird, the clothes, the hair – I volunteer!

And while famous marriages are beautiful, passionate, and filled with attractive people living lavish lifestyles, they’re usually fleeting. Not too many relationships make it through the Hollywood ringer successfully. Still, it’s fun to look back at the celebrities who once loved each other, but didn’t last in the public eye.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Eddie Murphy &amp; Tracey Edmonds</h2><p>Funnyman Eddie Murphy got married to record exec and film producer Tracey Edmonds in Bora Bora on New Year’s day back in 2008.

You need to have some sort of method of turning money into more money, or otherwise you’ll just end up being financially average. While that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, society is making it easier and easier to make a living passively. Heck, you could even replace your job with one of these methods altogether and earn your money without putting in the hard work.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some things you could do in 2021 to generate more money passively.</p><h2><strong>Real Estate&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Buying houses, renovating them and selling them again is still a surefire way to gain income. If you’re somewhat handy and can do most of the work yourself, the markup on a renovated house can easily be enough to make sure you don’t need to work for an entire year.

In many countries, carpets are placed on the walls instead of the floor, as they are considered very fashionable and stylish. But in the civilized world, the retro style is slowly dying out, and carpets are being treated as decorative floor rugs. Unusual carpets under your feet can completely change the room, making it more colorful, increasing the space, or vice versa, making it smaller.

It’s something they worry about constantly, but anxiety and overthinking can only make the problem worse. There are actually quite a few things you can do to increase your libido and prevent any future problems. Most of these things are regular everyday activities that you might just be slacking on, and getting back on track will make you right as rain in no time.</p><h2><strong>1. Exercise Regularly</strong></h2><p>Leading a very sedentary life can actually cause problems with libido. It’s important to keep your body healthy and moving by exercising regularly. You don’t necessarily have to hit the gym every day and lift weights like a pro, but just doing some exercises 3 to 4 times a week and making sure to at least go on a walk or a run in between, can make a huge difference.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-82103"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2. Manage Stress</strong></h2><p>Stress is a major factor in everyone’s life, and we rarely can control the circumstances that stress us out. But stress and anxiety can definitely lower your libido and cause other problems. The key is to learn how to manage stress. Find ways to not let stress take over your life. Try meditation, exercises like yoga or a walk in the park, even breathing techniques can help one deal with stress.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-2-1024x683.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-82104"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-2-400x267.jpeg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-2.jpeg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/interesting/7-qualities-all-women-look-for-in-a-perfect-partner/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>7 Qualities All Women Look For In A Perfect Partner</strong></a></p><h2><strong>3.

But doing regular annual checkups can prevent a lot of problems and catch things early before it gets worse. It’s also a great opportunity to ask the doctor all the questions that you might have about health, what’s normal and what’s not and when to start worrying about your health. Perhaps you’re worrying about nothing, a doctor can take a look, run the necessary test and let you know if there’s anything you should be concerned about.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-7-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-82113"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-7-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-7-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-7-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-7.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p></p><p></p></div>"

Given the high budgets, production deadlines, and the hours spent shooting the same take over and over again, actors generally have little leeway to adlib or react in a way that differs from how the scene is described in the original script. However, there are some situations in which an actor’s decision to go off script results in something brilliant and memorable. With that in mind, check out this list of 8 times when an improvised moment made its way into the movie.</p><h2>1. Harrison Ford in&nbsp;Star Wars Episode II: The Empire Strikes Back</h2><p>Near the end of&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>&nbsp;when Han Solo (Ford) surrenders to the Empire and is about to be frozen in carbonite, Princess Leia (Carry Fisher) reveals her feelings for him, saying, “I love you.” In the original script, Solo responds with, “I love you, too.” However, Ford realized saying this would have been completely out of character, which is why he adlibbed an emotional “I know.” It’s regarded as one of the most beautifully improvised moments in cinema history.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84599"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-1.jpg 1920w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2>2.

Dustin Hoffman in&nbsp;<em>Midnight Cowboy</em></h2><p><em>Midnight Cowboy</em>&nbsp;generated a lot of controversy when it became the first X-rated movie to hit mainstream theaters. It even won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1969, and to this day is the only X-rated movie to ever do that. In a scene where Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) are walking across a busy Manhattan street, Hoffman is nearly hit by an actual taxi. He pounds the hood of the car with his fist and scolds the driver, “Hey! I’m walking here! I’m walking here!” Contrary to popular belief, the original shot wasn’t included in the movie, but Director John Schlesinger liked Hoffman’s reaction so much that he added it to the script. They put an extra into the taxi and filmed it a few more times until they had the scene they wanted.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""559"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-1024x559.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84601"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-400x218.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-768x419.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Famous-Movie-Moments-That-Werent-In-the-Original-Script-3-2048x1118.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>4.

After giving a long-winded explanation, Zoolander asks, “But why male models?” This would seem to hammer home the point that Derek is an idiot, but in reality Stiller repeated the question because he had forgotten his next line.

There’s a scene where Edward Lewis (Gere) opens a jewelry box to reveal a necklace that he’s giving Vivian Ward (Roberts) to wear at an opera. In the original script, she was simply supposed to take it. But Gere decided to make things a bit more interesting by snapping the box closed over her gloved finger.

Connors deals with the encounter differently each time, including punching Ned in the face. But the scene where Connors responds with, “Ned Ryerson.

While other celebrities have been gracing the big screen well before they even reached puberty. These child stars have had to learn how to grow up while being household names, and having America witness every one of their great career milestones, and also their low moments in life as well. Nonetheless, these kid celebrities began amassing their wealth at such a young age, and many have continued to do so into their adult careers. But which stars truly beat the odds to earn ridiculous wealth at such young ages? These are the top 10 richest child stars of all time.</p><h2><strong>Abigail Breslin — Net worth: $16 Million</strong></h2><p>By the young age of 10, Abigail Breslin had already surpassed some of Hollywood’s most esteemed actors, by garnering an Oscar nomination for <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. Because of this recognition, she was able to begin asking for no less than $2 million for her movie appearances. By age 15, Breslin had so much clout that she earned a whopping $275,000 for only one week on the set of the smash-hit comedy New Year’s Eve.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""1002"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-1024x1002.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84164"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-1024x1002.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-307x300.jpg 307w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-768x751.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>Shirley Temple — Net worth: $30 Million</strong></h2><p>At the height of her career, Shirley Temple was one of the biggest child stars of her time.

We learn from our mistakes, and after watching these eight TV shows, we all realized where the bottom line was really drawn.</p><p>Here’s the list of worst 2020 TV shows you should only watch if you have absolutely nothing better to, including watching paint dry in winter weather.</p><h2>1. The Goop Lab</h2><p>Right off the bat, we’re getting stuck in some nasty goo(p). The Goop brand is Gwyneth Paltrow’s love child that’s meant to promote a healthy lifestyle by selling horrifically overpriced products to gullible customers. And the Goop Labs was a Netflix show, made to show us what’s going on behind the curtains. Too bad we already know it’s all a big scam that they’re trying to cover up with science and smart words. Look, if you spend 20 bucks on a piece of paper that’s supposedly vibrating at otherworldly frequencies, you’ve been had. Oh, and the show itself was really dull too.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-1-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84301"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2>2. Emily in Paris</h2><p>Next up is “Emily in Paris” —&nbsp; an incredibly dumb sitcom from the creators of “Sex and the City.” Don’t worry, I’m not being too harsh on it.

Space Force</h2><p>Steve Carell’s involvement in a project is almost always a sign that it will do great or at least that the fans will love it. We say “almost” because there have been a couple of duds in his career, including Netflix’s “Space Force.” As a fan of the US Office, it was painful for me to watch this mockumentary. Of course, it’s not all bad, but the majority of jokes felt like they were written either for or by 5-year-olds. And then it gets political for a while, falls flat on its face, and nobody wins. Good luck next time!</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84303"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/top-10-worst-movies-of-2020/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Top 10 Worst Movies of 2020</a></p><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>4. October Faction</h2><p>October Faction was one of the earliest 2020 flops, premiering on Netflix in early January. In fact, it was so bland that I forgot about its existence one week after I’d watched it. There are some cool action-horror elements and monster designs that would work much better with a bigger budget, but otherwise, October Faction is completely forgettable. Season two was canceled as far as we know, so there’s no point in watching a half-told story.

So, essentially it should have been a fun musical show, but even classic songs and well-choreographed dancing numbers couldn’t save it from the underlying office drama.

Having very little life experience, you need charisma, the innate ability to act convincingly, and the emotional maturity to deal with fame and success. While most child actors burnout or simply decide they’d rather live a normal life once they reach adulthood, others have maintained a solid career and are now worth tens of millions. Here are 8 such success stories.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Elijah Wood</h2><p><em>Net worth: $30 million</em></p><p>From the moment Wood made a brief cameo in Paula Abdul’s “Forever Your Girl” video at the age of 7, everybody was thinking, “He will be a Hobbit someday.” And everybody was so right! Although he’s best known for playing Frodo Baggins in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, he has more than a 100 movies under his belt during his 30-year acting career, and plenty of money as a result.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""579"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1-1024x579.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84230"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84230"" class=""wp-image-84230"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1-400x226.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1-768x434.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-1.jpg 1500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84231"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84231"" class=""wp-image-84231"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-2.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><h2>2. Frankie Muniz</h2><p><em>Net worth: $40 million</em></p><p>Here’s a useful tip: if you want to retire from acting at the age of 19, just land the titular role in a TV sitcom and hire an agent who’s good at negotiating contracts. After 7 seasons of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, Muniz was set for life. This gave him the opportunity to expand his horizons and dabble in competitive auto racing. Unfortunately, in 2017 he got into an accident on the race track, breaking his back in the process. But he went on to perform on <em>Dancing in the Stars </em>shortly thereafter and even finished in 3rd place, which means he clearly has the healing abilities of Wolverine.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""875"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-875x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84233"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84233"" class=""wp-image-84233"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-875x1024.jpg 875w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-256x300.jpg 256w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-768x899.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-1312x1536.jpg 1312w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-1749x2048.jpg 1749w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4.jpg 1798w"" sizes=""(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""721"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-721x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84232"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84232"" class=""wp-image-84232"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-721x1024.jpg 721w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-211x300.jpg 211w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-768x1091.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-1081x1536.jpg 1081w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3.jpg 1408w"" sizes=""(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/what-happened-to-your-favorite-child-actors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">What Happened to Your Favorite Child Actors?</a></strong></p><p></p><h2>3.

She’s still an A-list actress, but it’s only a matter of time before they start sticking her into roles where she’s playing the mother of an actor who in real life is only a couple of years younger than her because Hollywood is pretty much a terrible place for any woman over 40.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""526"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1-1024x526.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84238"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84238"" class=""wp-image-84238"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1-1024x526.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1-400x205.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1-768x394.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-8-1.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""780"" height=""438"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-7.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84237"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84237"" class=""wp-image-84237"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-7.jpg 780w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-7-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-7-768x431.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/top-10-richest-child-stars-of-all-time/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Top 10 Richest Child Stars of All Time</a></strong></p><p></p><p></p><center class=""native_ad""><!-- Composite Start --><div id=""M114019ScriptRootC208013""><!-- <div id=""M114019PreloadC208013""> -->        <!-- Loading...    </div> -->        <iframe style=""display: none;""></iframe><div id=""MarketGidComposite208013"" style=""overflow: visible; visibility: visible;""><div class=""mgbox""><!--advertPrefix--></div></div></div><!-- Composite End --></center><p></p><h2>5.

She took a break to attend college at Brown University (Ivy League, which is cool. But it’s still Brown, so yeah), but remains a mainstay in Hollywood.
