Quick Guide to the Amazing Characters You Will Meet In Hayao Miyazaki’s Worlds,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>The world-famous Japanese animation artist and director Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, which makes him 80 years old now. Miyazaki was one of the first animators to conquer the Western viewers with his kindhearted, kind of quirky, and sometimes deeply philosophical themes. In almost every Hayao Miyazaki movie, the viewers can find a few life lessons, some kids doing crazy things, mouth-watering food animation, and flying contraptions. Miyazaki just loves the things that allow people (and pigs) to soar in the sky. But let’s leave this for later.</p><p>Every scene looks very realistic and clean to the point that people call his animated movies “Japanese Disney.” Let’s look closer at some of the characters you’ll be meeting in Hayao Miyazaki’s worlds.</p><h2>1. Flying machines</h2><p>Something always has to fly in Miyazaki’s anime, and we don’t mean plain birds (get it?). We’re talking houses, castles, brooms, aircraft, strange insects, and other flying objects and structures. Why the fascination with this particular subject, you may ask? It turns out that Hayao’s father was the director of the factory producing aircraft components, and little Hayao spent a lot of time among the flying machines. Later on, the animator dedicated one of the movies, “The Wind Rises,” to his father. After its release, Miyazaki said that he was going to retire now, but as we all know now, he’s working on new movies and even called a press conference on this, but he had already done this before, so everyone is waiting for his next film.</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""833"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2-833x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82154"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82154"" class=""wp-image-82154"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2-833x1024.jpg 833w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2-244x300.jpg 244w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2-768x944.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2-1250x1536.jpg 1250w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-2.jpg 1328w"" sizes=""(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""600"" height=""450"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82155"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82155"" class=""wp-image-82155"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1.jpg 600w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-1-400x300.jpg 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/top-10-highest-rated-anime-on-imdb/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Top 10 Highest Rated Anime On IMDb</strong></a></p><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>2.

Brave little girls</h2><p>If you look closer at the main protagonists of Miyazaki’s films, you may notice a pattern: they’re almost always little girls that get into some sort of trouble but eventually overcome those difficulties and get a happy ending. This is how you know that Miyazaki is a proper feminist. In his world, these little women are the role models who save the day and never shy in the face of danger. Probably the youngest of them is a cute little tot named Ponyo, who comes from the deep blue sea.</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""557"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2-1024x557.png"" alt="""" data-id=""82161"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2.png"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82161"" class=""wp-image-82161"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2-1024x557.png 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2-400x218.png 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2-768x418.png 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-2.png 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""650"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-1024x650.png"" alt="""" data-id=""82163"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3.png"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82163"" class=""wp-image-82163"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-1024x650.png 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-400x254.png 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3-768x488.png 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-3.png 1039w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/7-most-evil-anime-villains/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>7 Most Evil Anime Villains</strong></a></p><!--nextpage--><h2>4. All kinds of witches</h2><p>In Miyazaki’s world, no character feels the same, especially when it comes to the antagonists. Yubaba, the evil bathhouse mistress from “Spirited Away,” for example, has a very cute twin sister, Zeniba. Sophie from “Howl’s Moving Castle” is watching after a witch who turned her into an old lady. And then we have the 13-year-old Kiki of the “Kiki’s Delivery Service,” who delivers packages on a broomstick and is generally cute as heck.</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82165"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82165"" class=""wp-image-82165"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-2.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""976"" height=""549"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82166"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82166"" class=""wp-image-82166"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4.jpg 976w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-4-768x432.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px""></figure></li></ul></figure><h2><strong>5. Spirits, good and bad</strong></h2><p>Generally speaking, Miyazaki’s movies don’t usually have a bad guy, but more often than not some nasty-looking spirit or creature will be posed as the film’s antagonist. Just because they look horrifying, doesn’t make them evil, right? In “Spirited Away” there are hundreds of Yokai, most of which are having fun. Kodama, the forest spirits in “Princess Mononoke,” are also a neutral party. Through characters’ attitude towards spirits and deities, the director reveals what they really are. Using these interactions, Miyazaki shows the harmony between the human and the spiritual worlds.</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-2.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82169"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-2.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82169"" class=""wp-image-82169"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-2.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-2-768x432.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""555"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-1024x555.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""82170"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=82170"" class=""wp-image-82170"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-400x217.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5-768x416.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-Guide-to-Characters-You-Will-Meet-In-Miyazaki-Worlds-5.jpg 1108w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/8-greatest-films-of-hayao-miyazaki/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>8 Greatest Films Of Hayao Miyazaki</strong></a></p><p></p></div>"
Gwen Stefani’s Transformation Through The Years,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Whether she’s rocking pink hair on stage or a glamorous dress on the red carpet, Gwen Stefani always shines brighter than everyone else.

In the early 1990s, when her band “No Doubt” was dominating the global music charts, she was fascinated by Indian culture. Back then, she was often seen wearing a bindi, the traditional red dot on her forehead, which quickly became a popular accessory among young fashionistas. The bindi, combined with fancy hairstyles, cherry-red lipstick, and sari, were definitely a part of her most iconic 90s look.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""754"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-1024x754.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-80997"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-400x294.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-768x565.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-1536x1130.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-1-2048x1507.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p></p><!--nextpage--><p><strong>2) Glam Rock Queen (2000-2003)</strong></p><p>In the 2000s, Gwen Stefani’s image began to transform, adapting to the waves of glamour oozing from every showbiz crack.

Her makeup has become less flashy, and even her iconic red lipstick has been shelved. In 2008, Stefani gave birth to her second child, after which she stepped away from the limelight to enjoy motherhood.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""616"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4-616x1024.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-80994"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4-616x1024.jpg 616w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4-181x300.jpg 181w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4-768x1276.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4-925x1536.jpg 925w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gwen-stefani-transformation-through-the-years-4.jpg 1000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px""></figure><span id=""addhere""></span><p><strong>5) The Icon of Style (2012-2020)</strong></p><p>In 2012, the long-awaited No Doubt reunion delighted their fans with the release of not one but two new singles.

The singer often appears in clothes she designed herself, and people seem to love those chic costumes. She manages to find a balance between femininity, doll-like innocence, and daring looks.

World’s Most Unusual Designer Carpets,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Carpets are usually very beautiful and have intricate patterns that you can stare at for hours. In many countries, carpets are placed on the walls instead of the floor, as they are considered very fashionable and stylish. But in the civilized world, the retro style is slowly dying out, and carpets are being treated as decorative floor rugs. Unusual carpets under your feet can completely change the room, making it more colorful, increasing the space, or vice versa, making it smaller. It all depends on the carpet’s shape, color, and design in general.</p><p>Let’s see just how weird the carpets can be!</p><p><strong>1. Selva Aparicio’s carved wooden rug</strong></p><p>You heard that right. It’s not an actual carpet. Instead, the designer, Selva Aparicio, has created intricate carvings that look like a real rug. This art piece supposedly symbolizes “covering and exposing, trauma and bearing witness,” and possibly, childhood trauma.

10 Secrets of Success from the World’s Richest Man – Elon Musk,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Thanks to the Tesla shares recently going up by 5% on January 7, 2020, the company’s founder and main owner, 49-year-old Elon Musk, became the richest man in the world, bumping Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos down to the second place. As of January 10, Musk reached a staggering benchmark — $209 billion (that’s $23 billion more than Bezos has). This gigantic achievement is the result of all the hard work he did in the past 12 months, during which his fortune grew by nearly $150 billion!</p><p>If you’re curious about how Elon Musk was able to achieve such success and want to learn from his experience, here are some tips from the creator of Tesla and SpaceX.</p><h2><strong>1. Self-education</strong></h2><p>Self-education is the path to success, according to Musk. He used to read encyclopedias instead of fiction books, like his peers. And today, each of us has access to Google, Wiki, and a bunch of free and premium learning courses that we can access anywhere, anytime. Also, according to Musk, the time spent scrolling social networks won’t lead to anything good. Memes don’t make dreams!</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-style-default""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""695"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/secrets-of-success-from-the-worlds-richest-man-elon-musk-1-1024x695.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-81146"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/secrets-of-success-from-the-worlds-richest-man-elon-musk-1-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/secrets-of-success-from-the-worlds-richest-man-elon-musk-1-400x271.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/secrets-of-success-from-the-worlds-richest-man-elon-musk-1-768x521.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/secrets-of-success-from-the-worlds-richest-man-elon-musk-1.jpg 1400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2.

Top 10 Worst Movies of 2020,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>2020 was a strange time for the film industry, with movie theatres being closed down for the majority of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic. This tumultuous time may have been the reason for Hollywood producing some pretty awful films this year. Choosing between the few most awful movies of the year is no small feat, as there were quite a few duds to hit the big screen. And although these movies didn’t technically bomb at the box office seeing as though they were closed, there were still several films that just missed the mark — regardless of the genre. Ready to take a trip down this past year’s terrible movie memory lane? Here are the top 10 worst movies of 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Dolittle</strong></h2><p>A reboot of the 1967 film entitled “Doctor Dolittle,” Dolittle was basically a flop from the start. After testing poorly during initial screenings, this film had an additional three weeks of shooting. Despite the patch job, Dolittle still performed terribly at the box office. It was also harshly criticized for several reasons. Critics deemed the film stale and boring, with poor scripts and visuals.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-style-default""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""573"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-10-Worst-Movies-of-2020-1-1024x573.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-81091"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-10-Worst-Movies-of-2020-1-1024x573.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-10-Worst-Movies-of-2020-1-400x224.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-10-Worst-Movies-of-2020-1-768x429.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-10-Worst-Movies-of-2020-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>Fantasy Island</strong></h2><p>A reimagination of 1977 television show Fantasy Island, this film just missed the mark to really connect with its targeted audience. Critics said that it didn’t connect with fans of the previous television show because it was too loosely based on the original.

8 Celebrities Who Grew Up Poor,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>The odds of becoming a wealthy, massively popular celebrity are minuscule no matter how you slice it, but some have the odds stacked significantly in their favor. For example, Adam Levine, the lead singer of Maroon 5, had the luxury of having a father who founded a retail chain. Bill Gates Sr., the father of the Microsoft founder who shares his name, was a successful, rich lawyer and civic leader in his own right. On the other hand, when somebody who comes from a broken home — or doesn’t have a home at all — makes it big, it’s a true rags-to-riches story that we can all get behind. Here are 8 such entertainment figures who went from zero to hundreds of millions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jay-Z</strong></p><p>Rapper Jay-Z — born Shawn Carter — has been a huge deal for almost 2 decades.

But while Jay-Z is worth $800 million today (plus another quarter of a billion dollars if you include his wife’s net worth), when he was growing up in the projects of Brooklyn, he was selling crack to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-style-default""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-80784"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z-624x416.jpg 624w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jay-Z.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>Eminem</strong></p><p>When Eminem (Marshall Mathers) was a young child, his parents were in a small-time band called Daddy Warbucks, performing at hotels in farflung towns in Montana and the Dakotas.

7 Tips For Men To Maintain Healthy Libido,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Libido is a very popular concern when it comes to men’s health. It’s something they worry about constantly, but anxiety and overthinking can only make the problem worse. There are actually quite a few things you can do to increase your libido and prevent any future problems. Most of these things are regular everyday activities that you might just be slacking on, and getting back on track will make you right as rain in no time.</p><h2><strong>1. Exercise Regularly</strong></h2><p>Leading a very sedentary life can actually cause problems with libido. It’s important to keep your body healthy and moving by exercising regularly. You don’t necessarily have to hit the gym every day and lift weights like a pro, but just doing some exercises 3 to 4 times a week and making sure to at least go on a walk or a run in between, can make a huge difference.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-82103"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Tips-For-Men-To-Maintain-Healthy-Libido-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2.

7 Qualities All Women Look For In a Perfect Partner,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Every woman is a mystery wrapped in an enigma with a question mark written on her face.

There’s no clear answer as to what makes this or that fellow stand out from the crowd, but at the same time, there are some common qualities that your favorite type of men share.</p><h2>Keen Mind</h2><p>Not all men are equally intelligent. The smarter they are, the more the women seem to like them. Smart is the new sexy, as they say! However, do not confuse the ability to solve a crossword with the ability to think and comprehend.

12 Of the Most Colorful Natural Wonders on Earth,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>The world can be kind of a boring place. Endless cornfields, lawns full of weeds, average-sized oak trees with green leaves. And water! Boo! Nothing makes me want to yawn more than the thought of a colorless, odorless liquid that doesn’t taste like anything. However, compiling a list of nature’s most boring phenomena won’t generate very many clicks. On the other hand, discussing some of the most beautiful natural wonders might just make me a hero around the office. So that’s what I’ve decided to treat you to! Here are 12 colorful places around the world.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>1. Rio Tinto, Spain</strong></h2><p>Rising in the Sierra Morena Mountains of southwestern Spain, this 60-mile (100 kilometers) river gets its stunning orange and red colors from copper, iron, and other heavy metals. The best way to enjoy the beauty is by visiting the small mining town of Nerva. Note that only about half the length of the river features these colors. Once you reach the town of Nieba it looks like just another boring, non-toxic river.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""684"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1024x684.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84282"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-768x513.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-01.jpg 2024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2. Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada</strong></h2><p>Known by First Nation folks as Ho-run-num-nay (Lake of the Little Fishes), this glacial lake located in Banff National Park gets its turquoise color from finely grained rock particles contained within the ice as it melts in the lake. If you’re a big fan of the movie <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>, you’ll be happy to know that there also happens to be a Lake Thelma. It’s in Minnesota, but conveniently located near the Canadian border!&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""676"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02-1024x676.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84283"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02-1024x676.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02-400x264.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02-768x507.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02-1536x1014.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-02.jpg 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/interesting/8-surprising-facts-about-colors-people-usually-get-wrong/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>8 Surprising Facts About Colors People Usually Get Wrong</strong></a></p><h2><strong>3.

The Lavender Fields of Provence, France</strong></h2><p>Provence, a geographical region of southeastern France is famous in the summers for its lush lavender fields. To see them with your own eyes, mosey on up to the Luberon and Verdon plateau regions north of Aix-en-Provence and Marseille, or head east past Avignon. But the window is rather brief; they start to blossom around the beginning of June and then by mid-July they’re done-zo.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84285"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Most-Colorful-Natural-Wonders-04.jpg 1800w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/travel/10-most-crazy-colored-places-on-earth/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>10 Most Crazy Colored Cities on Earth</strong></a></p><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2><strong>5. Laguna Colorada, Bolivia</strong></h2><p>Translated as Red Lagoon for all you non-Spanish speakers out there, this shallow salt lake is situated in Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve near the border with Chile. Where does the reddish-pink color come from, you ask? Is it runoff from the flamingos or something? Of course not, silly pants! It’s caused by a particular type of algae.

Who dumped all that Pepto Bismol into the lake?” you ask because you’re clever and figure nobody has ever made that joke before. It actually gets its color from — you guessed it — algae!

Top 8 Worst TV Shows Of 2020,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Everyone is talking about the best things that happened in 2020, presumably to dull the excruciating pain, but it doesn’t mean we should avoid highlighting the bad stuff. We learn from our mistakes, and after watching these eight TV shows, we all realized where the bottom line was really drawn.</p><p>Here’s the list of worst 2020 TV shows you should only watch if you have absolutely nothing better to, including watching paint dry in winter weather.</p><h2>1. The Goop Lab</h2><p>Right off the bat, we’re getting stuck in some nasty goo(p). The Goop brand is Gwyneth Paltrow’s love child that’s meant to promote a healthy lifestyle by selling horrifically overpriced products to gullible customers. And the Goop Labs was a Netflix show, made to show us what’s going on behind the curtains. Too bad we already know it’s all a big scam that they’re trying to cover up with science and smart words. Look, if you spend 20 bucks on a piece of paper that’s supposedly vibrating at otherworldly frequencies, you’ve been had.

Just watch “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” if you want some cheap laughs.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84302"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-400x267.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://herbeauty.co/en/fashion/10-best-looks-from-emily-in-paris/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>10 Best Looks from Emily in Paris</strong></a></p><h2>3. Space Force</h2><p>Steve Carell’s involvement in a project is almost always a sign that it will do great or at least that the fans will love it. We say “almost” because there have been a couple of duds in his career, including Netflix’s “Space Force.” As a fan of the US Office, it was painful for me to watch this mockumentary. Of course, it’s not all bad, but the majority of jokes felt like they were written either for or by 5-year-olds. And then it gets political for a while, falls flat on its face, and nobody wins. Good luck next time!</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84303"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Worst-TV-Shows-Of-2020-3.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/top-10-worst-movies-of-2020/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Top 10 Worst Movies of 2020</a></p><p></p><!--nextpage--><h2>4. October Faction</h2><p>October Faction was one of the earliest 2020 flops, premiering on Netflix in early January. In fact, it was so bland that I forgot about its existence one week after I’d watched it. There are some cool action-horror elements and monster designs that would work much better with a bigger budget, but otherwise, October Faction is completely forgettable. Season two was canceled as far as we know, so there’s no point in watching a half-told story.

So, essentially it should have been a fun musical show, but even classic songs and well-choreographed dancing numbers couldn’t save it from the underlying office drama.

Top 10 Richest Child Stars of All Time,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Some actors hit the silver screen after maturing as individuals, and begin to attain success into their adulthood. While other celebrities have been gracing the big screen well before they even reached puberty. These child stars have had to learn how to grow up while being household names, and having America witness every one of their great career milestones, and also their low moments in life as well. Nonetheless, these kid celebrities began amassing their wealth at such a young age, and many have continued to do so into their adult careers. But which stars truly beat the odds to earn ridiculous wealth at such young ages? These are the top 10 richest child stars of all time.</p><h2><strong>Abigail Breslin — Net worth: $16 Million</strong></h2><p>By the young age of 10, Abigail Breslin had already surpassed some of Hollywood’s most esteemed actors, by garnering an Oscar nomination for <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. Because of this recognition, she was able to begin asking for no less than $2 million for her movie appearances. By age 15, Breslin had so much clout that she earned a whopping $275,000 for only one week on the set of the smash-hit comedy New Year’s Eve.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""1002"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-1024x1002.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84164"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-1024x1002.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-307x300.jpg 307w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin-768x751.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Abigail-Breslin.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>Shirley Temple — Net worth: $30 Million</strong></h2><p>At the height of her career, Shirley Temple was one of the biggest child stars of her time.

"Then and Now: Child Stars From the 80s, 90s and 00s","<div class=""entry-content""><p>When most of us were kids, our greatest achievement was managing to not fall asleep until 4:00am when our friends came over for a slumber party. But child actors are not like most of us. From an early age, their acting skills put them directly in the spotlight and they end up with millions of fans even before they’re legally able to drive a car. Then they grow up and a lot of them vanish, either by choice or because they’re not cute anymore. But that’s not always the case. In fact, many childhood stars continue to make an impact in the entertainment industry while others have found success in other careers. Here’s a look at 10 actors who were huge as children and what they’re up to today.</p><p><strong>1. Dylan and Cole Sprouse</strong></p><p>The twin actors got their start when they were 8 months old as the “stars” of a diaper commercial. They got their first break in Hollywood when they shared the role of Julian in the Adam Sandler movie <em>Big Daddy</em>. But they achieved huge success in the Disney Channel show <em>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody</em>, which made them the wealthiest child actors of the mid-2000s, commanding as much as $40,000 an episode. They took a break from acting to attend New York University. Today Cole plays the role of Jughead Jones in the CW series <em>Riverdal</em>e while Dylan works as a brewmaster and owner of a meadery in Brooklyn.</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""819"" height=""614"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01A.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""81001"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01A.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=81001"" class=""wp-image-81001"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01A.jpg 819w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01A-400x300.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01A-768x576.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""81002"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-scaled.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=81002"" class=""wp-image-81002"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-400x266.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-768x512.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01B-2048x1364.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p><strong>2.

After her mother died of breast cancer, she lost her passion for acting and left in 2000. She’s returned to do a bit of voice acting, but she has stated that she’s done with acting and now wants to focus on writing.

Unfortunately, in 2017 he got into an accident on the race track, breaking his back in the process. But he went on to perform on <em>Dancing in the Stars </em>shortly thereafter and even finished in 3rd place, which means he clearly has the healing abilities of Wolverine.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""875"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-875x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84233"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84233"" class=""wp-image-84233"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-875x1024.jpg 875w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-256x300.jpg 256w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-768x899.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-1312x1536.jpg 1312w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4-1749x2048.jpg 1749w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-4.jpg 1798w"" sizes=""(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""721"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-721x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84232"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84232"" class=""wp-image-84232"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-721x1024.jpg 721w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-211x300.jpg 211w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-768x1091.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3-1081x1536.jpg 1081w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-3.jpg 1408w"" sizes=""(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://brainberries.co/movietv/what-happened-to-your-favorite-child-actors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">What Happened to Your Favorite Child Actors?</a></strong></p><p></p><h2>3.

It allowed DiCaprio to earn 8 figures ever since, and today he’s worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""682"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16-682x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84246"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84246"" class=""wp-image-84246"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-16.jpg 1333w"" sizes=""(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""810"" height=""1024"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14-810x1024.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84244"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84244"" class=""wp-image-84244"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14-810x1024.jpg 810w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14-237x300.jpg 237w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14-768x971.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14-1214x1536.jpg 1214w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-14.jpg 1265w"" sizes=""(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px""></figure></li><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" data-id=""84245"" data-full-url=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15.jpg"" data-link=""https://brainberries.co/?attachment_id=84245"" class=""wp-image-84245"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15-400x225.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-Former-Child-Actors-Who-Are-Rich-Beyond-Their-Wildest-Dreams-15.jpg 1080w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p><strong>RELATED:<a href=""https://brainberries.co/funny/10-times-leo-dicaprio-was-savage-af-and-we-loved-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> 10 Times Leo DiCaprio Was Savage AF and We Loved It</a></strong></p><p></p><h2>8.

The Best Passive Income Ideas for 2021,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>We all want to get rich, but it’s pretty much a fact that you won’t be able to pull that off just by working alone. You need to have some sort of method of turning money into more money, or otherwise you’ll just end up being financially average. While that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, society is making it easier and easier to make a living passively. Heck, you could even replace your job with one of these methods altogether and earn your money without putting in the hard work.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some things you could do in 2021 to generate more money passively.</p><h2><strong>Real Estate&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Buying houses, renovating them and selling them again is still a surefire way to gain income. If you’re somewhat handy and can do most of the work yourself, the markup on a renovated house can easily be enough to make sure you don’t need to work for an entire year. Since you’ll have to buy and renovate a house first though, it does require a bit of starting cash.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""485"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-01.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84152"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-01.jpg 800w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-01-400x243.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-01-768x466.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px""></figure><h2><strong>The Stock Market</strong></h2><p>While the stock market used to be a thing for the select few, most banks these days actually have different options if you want to start dabbling in the world of stock investment. It won’t be as lucrative as learning to do it yourself, but it takes almost no time and it’s a lot safer.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""800"" height=""532"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-02.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-84153"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-02.jpg 800w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-02-400x266.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/passive-income-02-768x511.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px""></figure><h2><strong>Become an Influencer</strong></h2><p>Granted, there’s some luck involved in this, but if you can somehow get some original and fun content out on social media on a relatively frequent basis, the money and sponsorship deals will roll in eventually.

10 Hacks For Getting the Best Possible Amazon Shopping Experience,"<div class=""entry-content""><p>Here’s something mind-blowing to think about: Nearly 50% of all e-commerce purchases in the U.S are done through Amazon. By comparison, its closest competitor eBay makes up a little more than 6% of the market while Walmart owns 3.7% of the online market. Why do so many people shop on Amazon? Membership with Prime is certainly a factor. A subscription gets you cloud storage, streaming access to tons of movies and TV shows, and even the ability to try on clothes and send them back if you don’t want them. Interested in becoming a Prime member yourself? Here are 10 reasons to consider making the investment.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>1. It’s easy to return purchased items</strong></h2><p>There are times when we order something and by the time it arrives, we’ve decided we either don’t need it anymore or it’s not what we had expected. Going to your Amazon account, clicking on the “return or replace” button, and following the prompts is a convenient way to send it back. But if you leave the item sitting around for a couple of months, you’ll notice that the button vanishes. Is it time to panic? Only if drama is a key characteristic of your personality. For the rest of you, you will probably still be able to return it as long as it’s in good condition and is within the refund window. Just call Amazon customer service and they’ll help you out.</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-style-default""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""585"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1-1024x585.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-81164"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1-400x229.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1-768x439.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>2. Not all returns are worth the refund or effort</strong></h2><p>Imagine receiving your $12 sweater and you’re disappointed because it doesn’t bring out the bright color of your eyes or it doesn’t look fashionable on you. If the item comes from a third-party vendor, you might find that you’re only able to receive a partial refund or you’re responsible for the shipping costs. In cases like that, it probably doesn’t make sense to bother sending it back. It doesn’t mean you have to throw it away though. Why not consider gifting it to a friend on their birthday? You can even pretend like you had always intended to buy it with them in mind. They’ll never have to know the truth!</p><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-style-default""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""644"" src=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-Tips-For-Getting-The-Best-Possible-Amazon-Shopping-Experience3-1024x644.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-81166"" srcset=""https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-Tips-For-Getting-The-Best-Possible-Amazon-Shopping-Experience3-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-Tips-For-Getting-The-Best-Possible-Amazon-Shopping-Experience3-400x252.jpg 400w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-Tips-For-Getting-The-Best-Possible-Amazon-Shopping-Experience3-768x483.jpg 768w, https://img-cdn.brainberries.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-Tips-For-Getting-The-Best-Possible-Amazon-Shopping-Experience3.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></figure><h2><strong>3.
